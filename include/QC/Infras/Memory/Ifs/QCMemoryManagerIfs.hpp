 * @file QCMemoryManagerIfs.hpp
 * @brief Interface definitions for the QC memory management system.
 *
 * This header defines the core interfaces and data structures for the QC memory management
 * subsystem. It provides:
 * - Handle types for identifying memory resources with proper comparison semantics
 * - Initialization structure for memory managers with copy semantics
 * - Abstract interface for memory manager implementations with state management
 *
 * The design emphasizes:
 * - Type safety through dedicated handle classes
 * - Clear ownership semantics via reference wrappers
 * - State management to prevent invalid operations
 * - Thread-safe operation requirements documented for each method
 *
 * @warning All handle types are process-specific and should not be shared across processes.
 *          The pid field in handles helps prevent accidental cross-process usage.

 * @struct QCMemoryHandle
 * @brief Type-safe identifier for memory resources associated with nodes.
 *
 * This class provides a unique identifier for memory allocations with the following properties:
 * - Encapsulates component fields rather than using raw bit manipulation
 * - Provides proper comparison operators for container usage
 * - Maintains process isolation via PID inclusion
 * - Ensures type safety (prevents accidental mixing with other handle types)
 *
 * The handle structure:
 * - nodeType: Type of the node that owns the memory (e.g., AI, DSP)
 * - nodeCount: Instance count for nodes of the same type
 * - randomNumber: Random value to ensure handle uniqueness
 * - pid: Process ID to prevent cross-process handle confusion
 *
 * @note This implementation uses separate fields rather than bit-packed values for:
 *       - Better type safety
 *       - Easier debugging
 *       - More maintainable code
 *       - Natural comparison semantics
 *
 * @warning Handles are only valid within the process that created them. The pid field
 *          helps detect accidental cross-process usage but is not a security measure.
